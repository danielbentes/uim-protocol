## Key Concepts

The UIM protocol is built on three fundamental concepts: Intents, Metadata and Parameters, and the Execute Method. Each plays a crucial role in facilitating efficient communication between AI agents and web services.

![Key concepts](images/concept.png)

### Intents

Intents are the core building blocks of the UIM protocol. They represent specific, predefined actions that an AI agent can perform on a web service. By standardizing these actions, UIM creates a common language for interaction, significantly reducing complexity and enhancing efficiency.

In practical terms, an intent is analogous to a function call in programming. It encapsulates a discrete task, complete with the necessary information to execute it. For example, an e-commerce platform might offer intents such as:

- SearchProducts: Enables product searches based on various criteria
- GetProductDetails: Retrieves detailed information about a specific product
- PlaceOrder: Initiates and processes a purchase transaction

Other intent examples can be found [here](intent_examples.md) for inspiration.

This standardization allows AI agents to interact uniformly across different services, streamlining development and improving reliability.

### Metadata and Parameters

Metadata and parameters provide the context and specifics needed to execute intents effectively. They serve as the blueprint for each intent, detailing its purpose and requirements.

Metadata typically includes:

- Name: A unique identifier for the intent
- Description: A concise explanation of the intent's function
- Category: The type of action (e.g., e-commerce, finance, healthcare)

Parameters specify the input required for the intent's execution. For a 'SearchProducts' intent, parameters might include:

- query (string): The search term
- category (string): The product category filter
- price_range (string): The price range filter
- sort_by (string): The sorting criteria

This structured approach ensures that AI agents can provide the necessary information in the correct format, facilitating accurate and efficient intent execution.

### The Execute Method

The execute method is the operational core of the UIM protocol. It manages the actual execution of intents, ensuring smooth interaction between AI agents and web services. The method operates in four key stages:

1. Input Validation: Verifies that all required parameters are present and correctly formatted
2. Execution: Interacts with the web service's API to perform the requested action
3. Response Formatting: Standardizes the web service's response for consistent interpretation by AI agents
4. Error Handling: Manages exceptions and provides meaningful feedback for error resolution

![The execute method overview](images/execute-method.png)

This systematic approach enhances reliability and simplifies troubleshooting, contributing to a more robust interaction framework.

## **System Architecture of the UIM Protocol: A Detailed Evaluation**

The UIM protocol is designed to facilitate seamless communication and interaction between AI agents and web services. In this section, we will delve into the system architecture of the UIM protocol, comparing and contrasting two proposed approaches: the Man-in-the-Middle Approach with a Centralized Repository and the Decentralized Approach with AI Agents Crawling Web Services. By evaluating the architectural differences, benefits, and potential challenges of each approach, we can gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each design, ultimately informing the selection of the most suitable architecture for implementors of the UIM protocol.

![Main architecture](images/main-architecture.png)

### **1. Man-in-the-Middle Approach: Centralized Repository**

**Overview:**
In the centralized approach, a central system acts as an intermediary (man-in-the-middle) between AI agents and web services. This central repository collects, manages, and provides access to intent information registered by web services. AI agents interact with this repository to discover available intents and execute actions on web services via standardized endpoints.

**Key Architectural Components:**

- **Central Repository**: The core of this architecture, where web services register their intents. This repository contains metadata, parameters, and execution details for each intent.
- **Service Management Endpoints**: Web services use these endpoints to register, update, and manage their intents in the repository.
- **Discovery Endpoints**: AI agents use these endpoints to search for available intents, fetch detailed information, and identify which actions they can execute.
- **Execution Endpoint**: Facilitates the actual execution of an action by forwarding requests from AI agents to the appropriate web service based on registered intents.
- **Policy Adherence and Security Layer**: Manages authentication, authorization, and rate limiting, often using the Policy Adherence Token (PAT) system. It ensures compliance and secure interaction between AI agents and web services.

![Centralized repository](images/centralized-repo.png)

**Architecture Flow:**

1. **Web Service Registration**: Web services register their intents with the central repository using service management endpoints. Alternatively, the system can automatically discover and register intents using a crawling mechanism.
2. **Intent Discovery**: AI agents query the discovery endpoints to identify relevant intents based on user requests.
3. **Intent Details Retrieval**: Once an intent is identified, the agent fetches detailed execution parameters from the repository.
4. **Execution**: The AI agent submits a request to the execution endpoint, which forwards it to the appropriate web service.
5. **Response Handling**: The results are returned to the AI agent, which then processes and presents the output to the user.

**Benefits:**

- **Centralized Management**: A single point of management for all intents simplifies oversight, updates, and maintenance.
- **Consistent Data Structure**: Standardized intent formats and metadata facilitate easier integration and use by AI agents.
- **Enhanced Security**: Centralized control over access, authentication, and rate limiting helps enforce security and compliance measures.
- **Reliable Monetization**: A clear, controlled pathway for monetization, allowing the central system to manage payments and enforce billing policies.

**Challenges:**

- **Scalability**: As the number of registered web services and AI agents grows, the central system must handle significant data volumes and high transaction loads.
- **Single Point of Failure**: Any issues with the central repository can disrupt the entire system, impacting both AI agents and web services.
- **Data Privacy Concerns**: Central storage of intent information may raise concerns about data ownership and privacy for web services.

#### **2. Decentralized Approach: AI Agents Crawling Web Services**

**Overview:**
In the decentralized approach, AI agents themselves are responsible for discovering and collecting intent information directly from web services. This is achieved through crawling mechanisms that utilize DNS TXT records and/or `agents.json` files hosted by web services. The intent information is stored locally by AI agents, allowing them to directly interact with web services without a centralized intermediary.

**Key Architectural Components:**

- **DNS TXT Records and `agents.json` Files**: These files are hosted by web services to provide intent metadata, execution details, policies, rate limits, and authentication methods. They act as a self-descriptive interface for AI agents.
- **Crawling Mechanism**: AI agents periodically or on-demand crawl these resources to collect and update intent information from various web services.
- **Local Intent Repository**: Each AI agent maintains its own repository of intent information, allowing it to execute actions based on the data collected from web services.
- **Execution Endpoint**: AI agents directly call execution endpoints on web services to perform actions, authenticated using data collected during crawling (e.g., PATs, OAuth tokens).
- **Policy Compliance and Security Layer**: Similar to the centralized model, but managed locally by each AI agent using the information gathered from `agents.json` and DNS records.

![AI-Agent architecture](images/ai-agent-architecture.png)

**Architecture Flow:**

1. **Crawling and Discovery**: AI agents crawl web services to gather available intents using DNS TXT records and `agents.json` files.
2. **Intent Data Storage**: The gathered data is stored locally within the AI agent’s repository, creating a personalized database of actions.
3. **Execution**: When a user request matches a stored intent, the AI agent directly interacts with the corresponding web service to execute the action.
4. **Compliance and Security**: The AI agent adheres to rate limits, billing requirements, and authentication methods as outlined in the collected intent data.
5. **Response Handling**: Results from the execution are processed and returned to the user.

**Benefits:**

- **Scalability**: Decentralization avoids the bottlenecks of a central system, allowing scalability across millions of AI agents and web services.
- **No Single Point of Failure**: Since intent information is distributed, the system remains robust even if some agents or services encounter issues.
- **Privacy and Ownership**: Web services maintain control over their intent data, reducing concerns about data privacy and centralization.
- **Flexible and Adaptable**: AI agents can quickly adapt to new services or changes in existing ones without waiting for updates in a central repository.

**Challenges:**

- **Inconsistent Data**: Without centralized control, there may be variations in how web services present their intent data, leading to potential inconsistencies. Adherence to the UIM protocol can help mitigate this issue.
- **Higher Complexity for AI Agents**: Each agent must handle crawling, data parsing, security, and compliance on its own, increasing the complexity of individual agents.
- **Maintenance Overhead**: AI agents need to frequently crawl and update intent information to stay current, which can be resource-intensive.

### **Comparative Evaluation of Both Approaches**

1. **Centralized Repository (Man-in-the-Middle)**
   - **Pros**: Streamlined management, consistent data structure, enhanced security, clear monetization strategy.
   - **Cons**: Scalability issues, single point of failure, potential data privacy concerns.

2. **Decentralized Crawling by AI Agents**
   - **Pros**: Scalability, robust against failures, privacy-friendly, adaptable to changes.
   - **Cons**: Potential inconsistencies, complex management for AI agents, resource-intensive maintenance.

### **Strategic Recommendations:**

- **Use Centralized Approach**: If the primary goal is to maintain strict oversight, enforce security protocols, and ensure a standardized user experience across all AI agents and web services.
- **Adopt Decentralized Approach**: If scalability, resilience, and data privacy are paramount, particularly in environments where rapid adaptation and autonomy are critical.
