## 1. Introduction

![Abstract UIM architecture](images/abstract.png)

### 1.1 Motivation

As Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology advances, there is a growing need for efficient, standardized interactions between AI agents and web services. Traditional methods such as web scraping and simulated user interactions are inefficient, unreliable, and often non-compliant with legal and ethical standards.

#### Challenges in Current AI-Agent Interactions

1. **Web Scraping Issues**
   - **Inconsistency**: Unpredictable changes in HTML structures lead to data extraction failures.
   - **Legal and Ethical Concerns**: Potential violations of terms of service and data privacy laws.

2. **Simulated Browser Interactions**
   - **Performance Overhead**: High resource consumption affects scalability.
   - **Dynamic Content Handling**: Difficulty managing JavaScript-rendered content, pop-ups, and CAPTCHAs.

3. **Lack of Standardization**
   - **Diverse APIs**: Inconsistent API designs require custom integrations.
   - **Data Formats**: Multiple data formats necessitate different parsers.

4. **Limited Access to Deep Functionality**
   - **Restricted Features**: Inability to access advanced functionalities due to API limitations.
   - **Inefficient Automation**: Hinders the development of sophisticated AI capabilities.

5. **Security and Compliance Challenges**
   - **Complex Authentication**: Varied authentication mechanisms complicate integration.
   - **Regulatory Compliance**: Navigating data protection laws like GDPR is challenging.

![Challenges in AI-Agent interactions with web services](images/challenges-spec.png)

### 1.2 Scope

The Unified Intent Mediator (UIM) protocol addresses these challenges by introducing a standardized, secure method for direct AI agent-web service interaction. This specification aims to:

- **Define the structure and format of intents.**
- **Establish mechanisms for discovery and execution of intents.**
- **Integrate Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) for policy management.**
- **Utilize Policy Adherence Tokens (PATs) for secure interactions.**
- **Provide comprehensive guidelines for implementation, ensuring interoperability and compliance.**

### 1.3 Out of Scope

While the Unified Intent Mediator (UIM) Protocol Specification aims to provide a comprehensive framework for AI agents to interact with web services, certain aspects are intentionally excluded to maintain focus and clarity. The following elements are not within the scope of this specification:

- **Implementation Details of AI Agents and Web Services**: The specification does not dictate the internal architecture or programming paradigms (e.g., object-oriented, functional programming) that AI agents or web services should adopt. It does not prescribe specific programming languages, frameworks, or libraries to be used in implementing the protocol.
- **Specific Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms**: Details regarding how credentials are stored, rotated, or managed are beyond the scope of this document.
- **Legal and Regulatory Compliance Beyond Data Privacy**: The specification does not cover compliance with laws beyond data privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA. It excludes areas such as export controls, accessibility laws, and sector-specific regulations (e.g., HIPAA for healthcare). Issues related to copyright, trademarks, or patents are not addressed.
- **User Interface and Experience Design**: The specification does not prescribe how users should interact with AI agents or how agents present information to users.

- **Party**: The entities involved in the policy (e.g., AI agents and web services).

**Sample ODRL Policy** is provided in [Appendix C](#c-sample-odrl-policy).

#### PAT Issuance Workflow

1. **Policy Retrieval and Agreement**:
   - AI agent retrieves the ODRL policy from the specified endpoint.
   - AI agent digitally signs the policy using its private key and sends it to the web service alongside its public key to request a PAT.

2. **PAT Issuance**:
   - Web service verifies the AI agent's signature and agreement.
   - Web service issues a PAT, which includes the agreed policy details, permissions, obligations, and a validity period.
   - The PAT is digitally signed by the web service.

3. **Using PAT in Requests**:
   - AI agent includes the PAT in the `Authorization` header of each request.
   - Web service verifies the PAT's signature and validity before processing the request.

**PAT Structure**:

**Sample PAT** is provided in [Appendix D](#d-sample-pat-structure).

#### Including PAT in Requests

The AI agent includes the PAT in the `Authorization` header:

```txt
Authorization: Bearer PAT-12345
```

#### Verification Process

1. **Extract PAT**: Web service extracts the PAT from the request header.
2. **Verify Signature**: Web service verifies the PAT's signature using its public key.
3. **Check Validity**: Web service checks the PAT's validity period.

- **Replay Attacks**: PATs SHOULD include nonce values or timestamps to prevent replay attacks.
- **Input Validation**: Web services MUST validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks.

## 9. Privacy Considerations

- **Data Minimization**: AI agents and web services SHOULD minimize the collection and storage of personal data.
- **Compliance**: Adherence to regulations like GDPR and CCPA is REQUIRED where applicable.
- **User Consent**: When personal data is involved, explicit user consent MUST be obtained.
- **Transparency**: Privacy policies SHOULD be clearly communicated through the `service_privacy_policy_url`.
- **Anonymization**: Where possible, data SHOULD be anonymized to protect user identities.

### F. Visual Aids

#### High Level System Architecture Diagram

1. **Centralized Architecture**:

   - **AI Agent** interacts with the **Central Repository** for discovery, policy agreement, and execution.
   - **Central Repository** communicates with **Web Services** to forward execution requests and receive responses.
  ![Centralized flow](images/central-arch-box.png)

2. **Decentralized Architecture**:

   - **AI Agent** discovers **Web Services** via DNS TXT records and `agents.json` files.
   - **AI Agent** communicates directly with **Web Services** for policy agreement and intent execution.
  ![Decentralized flow](images/decentral-arch-box.png)

3. **Hybrid Approach**:

   - **AI Agent** uses the **Central Repository** for intent discovery.
   - **AI Agent** interacts directly with **Web Services** for policy agreement and execution.
